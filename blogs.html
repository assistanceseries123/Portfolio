    <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer
         science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that 
         humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.</p>

        
    
    <h2>How does Machine Learning Works?</h2>
    <p>A Decision Process: In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification.
         Based on some input data,
         which can be labeled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.</p>
        
    <p>An Error Function: An error function evaluates the prediction of the model.
         If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.</p>
        
         <p>A Model Optimization Process: If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set,
             then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate.
              The algorithm 
            will repeat this iterative “evaluate and optimize” process, 
            updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met. </p>
    
    <h1>Machine learning versus deep learning versus neural networks</h1>
    <p>Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s worth noting the nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks.

        The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. "Deep" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. The deep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form , and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention required and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning as "scalable machine learning" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (link resides outside ibm.com).
        
        Classical, or "non-deep," machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.</p>
    
    <h1>Machine learning methods</h1>
    <h3>Machine Learning model falls into three categories</h3>
    <h4>supervised Machine Learning</h4>
    <p> It is also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to 
        train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. 
        As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately.
         This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting.
          Supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, 
          such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised 
          learning include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random 
          forest, and support vector machine (SVM).</p>
